Steve: Yet, as I start to live in this world longer, I have this feeling that the Overworld just isn't enough for me. I wish to go on a bigger journey, and take on a much, much bigger threat.

MINECRAFT:
THE MOVIE
(As the movie's logo is shown, it fades to a shot of the sun rising above a blocky grass hill, casting a flare. It then cuts to the camera flying across a grass plains biome, becoming panning up to reveal a large village community. At this village, there were villagers doing their regular jobs.)

Weaponsmith: (shaping up a sword with a hammer)

Cleric: (brewing potions in a brewing stand)

Armorer: (smelting iron in a blast furnace)

Butcher: (roasting pork in a smoker oven)

Librarian: (writing up enchantments on a lectern)

(Then, the camera turns around and flies over to the entrance of a cave. There, a light illuminates from the inside, and a miner dressed in a light blue shirt and bluish-purple pants comes out.)

Steve: (covered in coal dust, panting in exhaustion; wipes sweat from forehead) Whew! All of that mining took a really long time! But, I'm finally glad to have it done and over with.
